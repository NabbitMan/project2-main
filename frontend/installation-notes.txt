# To create a top level app

python manage.py startapp polls


# Let your project know about your app including the app name in INSTALLED_APPS inside settings.py 

# Create a model

# Activate the model

python manage.py makemigrations polls

# Check what migrations will occur i.e. view the SQL

python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001

python manage.py migrate


# So, Basically the three-step guide to making model changes:

# Change your models (in models.py).
# Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
# Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

# To play with the DB API

python manage.py shell

# Creating a superuser

python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver 0:3000
localhost:3000/admin

# To allow models from our app to be managed via the admin site, register that model on polls/admin.py
